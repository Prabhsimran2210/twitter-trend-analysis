The project is developed using Visual Studio with C# .Net as programming language. There is only one entity that will have the access to the system, which is user. The user will be allowed to search for the latest trends by inputting a keyword into search field. Based on user provided keyword, the system will search for similar keywords in database and summarize the total count to provide the trending tweets on twitter. The trending tweets with hashtag (#) will be displayed first and then the rest words will be displayed. By clicking on every trending tweet, the user commented tweets would be displayed. User can view all the tweets from the searched keyword.
